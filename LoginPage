1. It is best practice for websites to always return the same status code regardless of the outcome.
## Why?
During a brute-force attack, the returned HTTP status code is likely to be the same for the vast majority of guesses because most of them will be wrong. If a guess returns a different status code, this is a strong indication that the username was correct.

2. Use generic error message whether both the username AND password are incorrect or only the password was incorrect.
## Why?
User-name/Password enumeration
##Ensure
That there are no small typing errors.  Just one character out of place makes the two messages distinct, even in cases where the character is not visible on the rendered page.

3. Having similar reponse times for both request.
## Why?
 If most of the requests were handled with a similar response time, any that deviate from this suggest that something different was happening behind the scenes. This is another indication that the guessed username might be correct. For example, a website might only check whether the password is correct if the username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the response time. This may be subtle, but an attacker can make this delay more obvious by entering an excessively long password that the website takes noticeably longer to handle.
